          significant challenges faced by farmers. Our paper reviews existing IoT-based applications in agriculture and
          introduces a user-friendly irrigation system utilizing Arduino UNO, a Bluetooth module, and a soil-moisture
          sensor. Unlike previous complex systems, our solution emphasizes simplicity and ease of use for farmers. The
          system enables real-time monitoring of soil moisture and allows farmers to set customized moisture thresholds
          for different crops. When soil moisture drops below the set threshold, the system automatically activates
          irrigation, helping to prevent both overwatering and underwatering, thereby improving agricultural efficiency.

        <div class="abstract">Abstract: This research paper addresses a significant literature gap in healthcare
          monitoring systems by proposing a novel methodology that integrates weight monitoring into an Internet of
          Things (IoT)-based framework. In the era of technological advancement, IoT serves as a powerful tool for
          obtaining health-related data remotely. While existing studies have explored various IoT applications,
          including connected cars and automated residences, the crucial parameter of patient weight has been overlooked
          in current healthcare monitoring systems. The proposed methodology leverages the ESP8266 module for Wi-Fi
          connectivity, facilitating seamless data transmission and remote monitoring capabilities. Key IoT applications
          such as oxygen sensors, heart rate sensors, ECG modules, and temperature sensors are already established in
          healthcare systems, but the incorporation of a weight sensor is essential for a holistic understanding of a
          patient's overall health. Regular monitoring of weight provides valuable insights, enabling healthcare
          providers to make informed decisions. Through the integration of a weight sensor, this research enhances the
          capabilities of healthcare providers, allowing them to remotely access accurate and real-time weight
          measurements alongside other vital signs. This comprehensive approach empowers healthcare professionals to
          deliver more effective care, especially in remote settings where regular patient visits may be challenging.

          platform edges during high-traffic hours. This study proposes an IoT-based alert system aimed at enhancing

          insufficient training, poor communication between station masters and field workers, and high-risk exposure to
          active tracks. By detecting track vibrations and notifying supervisors in real-time, the device significantly
          lowers the risk of accidents. The paper details the design, testing, and real-world applicability of this IoT
